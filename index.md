# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Boshen Kang and I am a student at Cal State Fullerton and my major is Computer Science.

## Facorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Favorite Labs and Reflection #1
  My favorite lab was Lab 1 because it was my first experience writing a C++ program. After writing a few lines of code, I was excited to see the output on the console. It was also helpful to understand the structure of a C++ program and how the `#include <iostream>` directive allows a program to interact with the console. The simple task of printing "Hello Steven!" gave me confidence in my ability to write more complex programs in the future.
  
* Favorite Labs and Reflection #2
  Lab 7 was my second favorite because I enjoyed using conditions and functions to solve real-world problems like parking restrictions. I was able to write multiple functions for different streets, each with unique parking rules. For example, in the CanParkOnAsh function, I implemented a rule that parking is not allowed on Ash Street between 10am and 12pm on Wednesdays. This experience of creating a function to determine parking eligibility based on a specific date and time was a novel experience for me.

* Favorite Labs and Reflection #3
  The third lab I liked was Lab 10. I particularly enjoyed learning how to use two-dimensional vectors and apply loops to manipulate them. Using loops to extract county names, using std::stoi() for type conversion, calculating specific population values, and summarizing all populations were all practical and enjoyable tasks. It was fun to see how small details in the code came together to solve larger problems (such as calculating the total population of a state). Of course, the most important thing was that my partner in this lab and I had a good rapport.
